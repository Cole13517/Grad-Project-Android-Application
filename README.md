# Grad-Project-Android-Application
This is the android application developed for my CE grad project, using Firebase, Google Maps API, and Android System permissions (SMS Permissions), the user of this application can send out specific location coordinates to a specific phone number, and then generate a geolocation domain overlay on top of a google map activity using those coordinates.
